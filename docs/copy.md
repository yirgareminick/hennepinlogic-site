### Problem Statement Section

**Headline:**  
The Math on Missed Calls Hurts

**Body:**  
- 30% of after-hours calls go unanswered in home services
- 85% of leads convert when contacted within 5 minutes
- That drops to 20% after just 30 minutes
- Every missed emergency call = $400–$800 walking out the door

**Subtext:**  
Your competitors aren't better—they're just faster. We fix that.

---

### The 60-Second System Section

**Headline:**  
How the 60-Second System Works

**Subheadline:**  
A lead comes in. We respond in under 60 seconds. You get the job.

**Steps:**

1. **Lead Comes In**  
   Missed call, web form, Google Business Profile, or Facebook—we catch it all.

2. **Instant Text Response**  
   Within 60 seconds, the lead gets a personalized text: "Hey, this is [Your Company]. How can we help?"

3. **Info Capture**  
   Our system collects what you need: service type, address, urgency, best callback time.

4. **Emergency Escalation**  
   Urgent issue? We text or call your on-call person immediately.

5. **Follow-Up Sequence**  
   Lead goes quiet? We follow up 2–3 times over 48 hours so nothing falls through the cracks.

6. **Weekly Report**  
   Every week, you get a report: response times, leads captured, jobs recovered.

### FAQ Section

**Headline:**  
Questions We Get

**Q: Will this spam my customers?**  
A: No. We send one initial response and a short follow-up sequence (2–3 messages max). Every message includes opt-out language. We follow TCPA guidelines.

**Q: Does this replace my receptionist or dispatcher?**  
A: No—it supports them. The system handles the instant response so your team can focus on dispatching, scheduling, and customer service. Think of it as your 24/7 backup.

**Q: What happens after hours?**  
A: That's where we shine. The system works 24/7. Missed a call at 2 AM? The lead still gets a text in 60 seconds. Emergencies get escalated to whoever's on call.

**Q: What integrations do you support?**  
A: We connect to your phone system, website forms, Google Business Profile, and Facebook. If you use ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, or Jobber, we can discuss CRM integrations too.

**Q: What if I don't like it after the pilot?**  
A: You walk away. No contracts, no pressure. We'll even give you a summary of what we learned so you can apply it elsewhere.

**Q: How fast is setup?**  
A: Most pilots are live within 48 hours of kickoff.

## Plumbing Landing Page Copy

### Hero

**Pre-headline:**  
For Minneapolis Emergency Plumbers

**Headline:**  
Stop Losing $500+ Jobs to the Plumber Who Answers First

**Subheadline:**  
70% of your work is emergency calls. When you miss one, it's gone in 60 seconds—to someone faster. Our speed-to-lead system texts back instantly so you book the job, not your competitor.

**CTA:**  
Book a 10-Min Walkthrough →

---

### Pain Points Section

**Headline:**  
The Real Cost of Slow Response

**Pain Point 1: Missed After-Hours Calls**  
You can't answer every call at 2 AM. But your competitor's answering service can. Every missed call is a burst pipe or clogged drain walking out the door.

**Pain Point 2: Slow Follow-Up on Web Leads**  
Someone fills out your form. You see it the next morning. By then, they've already booked someone else.

**Pain Point 3: No System for Emergencies**  
Is it a "my toilet is running" call or a "water is flooding my basement" call? Without triage, everything feels urgent—or nothing does.

---

### Solution Section

**Headline:**  
What the 60-Second System Does for Plumbers

**Features:**

- **Instant missed-call text-back** — Lead gets a text within 60 seconds, even if you're on a job
- **Web form auto-response** — No more stale leads sitting in your inbox overnight
- **Emergency triage** — System asks the right questions, escalates true emergencies to your on-call tech
- **Lead capture** — Service type, address, urgency, callback time—all logged before you call back
- **Follow-up sequence** — If they don't respond, we nudge them twice over 48 hours
- **Weekly report** — See exactly how many leads came in, response times, and jobs recovered

---

### Social Proof Placeholder

**Headline:**  
Minneapolis Plumbers Using the System

**Placeholder:**  
> "Since installing the 60-second system, we've recovered at least 8-10 jobs per month that would have gone to competitors. Setup was painless."  
> — *[Name], [Plumbing Company], Minneapolis*

---

### Pilot CTA

**Headline:**  
Try It for 30 Days: $950

**Body:**  
Full setup. 24/7 monitoring. Weekly reports. No long-term contract. If it doesn't work, you walk away.

**CTA:**

## Restoration Landing Page Copy

### Hero

**Pre-headline:**  
For Minneapolis Water Damage Restoration Companies

**Headline:**  
In Water Damage, the First Responder Wins

**Subheadline:**  
When someone's basement is flooding, they're not comparison shopping. They're calling until someone picks up. Our 60-second system makes sure that someone is you—24/7/365.

**CTA:**  
Book a 10-Min Walkthrough →

---

### Pain Points Section

**Headline:**  
What's Costing You Jobs

**Pain Point 1: Missed Emergency Calls**  
Water damage doesn't wait for business hours. Neither do your competitors. A missed 3 AM call is a $3,000–$5,000 mitigation job you'll never see.

**Pain Point 2: Insurance Adjusters Want Fast Response**  
When an adjuster refers a homeowner your way, they expect you to move fast. Slow response = lost referral relationships.

**Pain Point 3: No 24/7 Coverage Without Night Staff**  
You can't afford to staff phones overnight. But you also can't afford to lose overnight leads to the company that does.

---

### Solution Section

**Headline:**  
What the 60-Second System Does for Restoration

**Features:**

- **24/7 instant response** — Lead gets a text within 60 seconds, day or night, weekends and holidays
- **Emergency escalation** — True emergencies (flooding, sewage, fire damage) go straight to your on-call tech
- **Lead qualification** — System captures property type, water source, timeline, insurance info
- **Multi-channel coverage** — Phone, web, Google Business Profile, Facebook—all covered
- **Follow-up automation** — Leads who go quiet get 2–3 follow-ups over 48 hours
- **Weekly reporting** — Track leads, response times, and jobs won

---

### Social Proof Placeholder

**Headline:**  
Twin Cities Restoration Companies Using the System

**Placeholder:**  
> "We were losing after-hours leads to competitors with call centers. Now we respond in under a minute, and we've seen a measurable increase in booked mitigation jobs."  
> — *[Name], [Restoration Company], Twin Cities*

---

### Pilot CTA

**Headline:**  
Try It for 30 Days: $950

**Body:**  
Full setup. 24/7 monitoring. Weekly reports. No long-term contract. If it doesn't deliver, you walk away.

## How It Works Page Copy

### Hero

**Headline:**  
How the 60-Second System Works

**Subheadline:**  
A simple system that responds to leads faster than humanly possible—so you book more jobs without adding staff.

---

### Steps Section

**Step 1: Connect Your Lead Sources**  
We connect to your phone line, website forms, Google Business Profile, and Facebook. Setup takes about 48 hours. You don't need to learn any software.

**Step 2: Leads Come In, We Respond**  
Missed call at 11 PM? Lead form submitted on Sunday? Doesn't matter. Within 60 seconds, the lead gets a text acknowledging their request and asking a few qualifying questions.

**Step 3: We Capture the Key Info**  
The system collects what your dispatcher needs: what service they need, their address, how urgent it is, and the best time to call back.

**Step 4: Emergencies Get Escalated**  
If it's a true emergency—flooding, no hot water, sewage backup—the system immediately texts or calls your on-call person. No delay.

**Step 5: Follow-Up Runs Automatically**  
If a lead doesn't respond to the first message, we send 2–3 follow-ups over 48 hours. No lead falls through the cracks.

**Step 6: You Get Weekly Reports**  
Every week, you get a report showing: leads received, average response time, leads recovered, and any patterns we notice.

## About Page Copy

### Hero

**Headline:**  
Built in Minneapolis. Built for You.

**Subheadline:**  
We're not a big tech company trying to sell you software. We're a small team that helps local service businesses book more jobs.

---

### Our Story

**Headline:**  
Why We Started Hennepin Logic

**Body:**  
We kept hearing the same story from plumbers and restoration pros in Minneapolis:

*"I know I'm losing jobs. Calls come in when we're on a job or after hours. By the time we call back, they've already booked someone else."*

The solutions out there were either too expensive (full call centers), too complicated (enterprise software), or too impersonal (national platforms that don't understand local markets).

So we built something different: a simple, turnkey system that responds to leads in 60 seconds—without you needing to hire night staff or become a software expert.

We focus exclusively on plumbing and restoration companies in the Twin Cities because we know the market, the seasonal spikes, and what local operators actually need.

---

### Why Local Matters

**Headline:**  
Minneapolis Is Home

**Body:**  
We're based here. We understand the rhythm of the market—the frozen pipe calls in January, the flooding in spring, the water heater rush in fall.

We're available for in-person meetings. We answer our phones. We're not going to route you to a support ticket queue in another time zone.

When you work with us, you're working with people who live in the same city, understand your business, and are invested in your success.
